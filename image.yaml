    - name: MAVEN_ARGS
      description: Arguments to use when calling Maven, replacing the default `package hawt-app:build -DskipTests -e`. Please be sure to run the `hawt-app:build` goal (when not already bound to the `package` execution phase), otherwise the startup scripts won't work.
      example: "-e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga package"

      description: Arguments to use when copying artifacts from the output directory to the application directory. Useful to specify which artifacts will be part of the image. It defaults to `-r hawt-app/*` when a `hawt-app` directory is found on the build directory, otherwise jar files only will be included (`*.jar`).
      example: "-r hawt-app/*"
    - name: MAVEN_CLEAR_REPO
      description: If set then the Maven repository is removed after the artifact is built. This is useful for keeping the created application image small, but prevents *incremental* builds. Defaults to *false*.

    - name: JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO
      description: Is used when no `-Xmx` option is given in **JAVA_OPTIONS**. This is used to calculate a default maximal heap memory based on a containers restriction. If used in a Docker container without any memory constraints for the container then this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint then `-Xmx` is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here. The default is `50` which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0` in which case no `-Xmx` option is added.
      example: "40"

      description: A jar file with an appropriate manifest so that it can be started with `java -jar` if no **JAVA_MAIN_CLASS** is set. In all cases this jar file is added to the classpath, too.

      description: Name to use for the process.
      example: "demo-app"
    - name: JAVA_CLASSPATH
      description: The classpath to use. If not given, the startup script checks for a file `**JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath**` and use its content literally as classpath. If this file doesn't exists all jars in the app dir are added (`classes:**JAVA_APP_DIR/***`).
